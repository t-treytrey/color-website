    <h1>How does color affect our Clothes? </h1>

    <h3>Color is an essential element in fashion design. It can evoke emotions, set the tone for a collection, and even influence the overall look and feel of a design. As a fashion designer, understanding the power of colour is crucial for creating an impactful and evocative collection.</h3>

    <h3>Colloidal matter in dye prevents the penetration of sunlight necessary for the process of photosynthesis â€“ creating plumes of invasive algae. Mills discharge millions of gallons of effluent as hazardous toxic waste; full of color and organic chemicals from dyeing and finishing salts.</h3>

    <h3>Wearing Bright Colors May Help Boost Energy
      Bright colors reflect more light. So when we see ourselves in bright clothes, it's a little like caffeine for the eyes: a burst of vibrancy that gives us a lift. And as we've see, bright colors are associated with positive emotions, which are naturally energizing.</h3>
